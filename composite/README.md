# Composite 
>  The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. 

We create a set of objects to represent computer parts. Each part has a name and a price and some parts are composed of other parts. The composite pattern allows us to handle all parts uniformly, without having to worry about whether they are simple or complex.
